      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p><em>i.) What personal information (PI) is collected </em></p>
      <p>
        The data that is stored only pertains to information gathered from gameplay, which includes a player-
        entered name at the end of a playthrough, and the score attained during this playthrough. It is stored 
        in a text file on the device. It is not distributed elsewhere or accessible to anybody except the user.
      </p>
	
      <p><em><br />ii.) How the personal information is collected </em></p>
      <p>
        The personal information is gathered from the score game variable, and a user generated text input.
      </p>
	
      <p><em><br />iii.) Why youâ€™re collecting the personal data  </em></p>
      <p>
        The personal data is collected to generate a scoreboard that the user can refer back to in the settings menu.
      </p>
	
      <p><em><br />iv.) Who you might share the data with or sell it to </em></p>
      <p>
        The data will not be shared or sold to any entity-- it exists solely on the user's device and nowhere else.
      </p>

      <p><em><br />v.) How users can control their data </em></p>
      <p>
        Users can erase the text file data should they choose to not want a scoreboard, but it will auto fill after 
        each playthrough. The user can erase the text file as many times as they wish. 
      </p>
