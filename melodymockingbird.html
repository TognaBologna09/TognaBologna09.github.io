                            Engaging the 'Play' button ushers you into a realm of excitement.
                            An animation elegantly highlights one of the four buttons, extending an invitation for
                            you to emulate the sequence with musical accompaniment. As the melody gracefully unfolds,
                            you hold the power to 'interrupt' it at will. Tread carefully, begin your replication, but doing so early will halt the melody's
                            progress. This ingenious mechanic wills you to rely on patience before copying the melody's rendition.<br />

                            Navigate through the app's intuitive interface with ease. The main menu unveils two prominent buttons:
                            'Play' and 'Settings.' Within the Settings menu, you wield the power to fine-tune your gaming experience.
                            Adjust parameters such as tempo, toggle the innovative 'six mode,' and even manage audio preferences
                            with the touch of a button. Additionally, you gain access to a treasure trove of previous playthrough
                            scores for retrospective admiration.
