      <h2>MELODY MOCKINGBIRD</h2>
      <p>Melody Mockingbird is a mobile app game for iOS that will test your memory to mimic the longest tune.
        This game invites the player to observe ordered auditory and visual cues and then replay them, with increasing 
        difficulty the game tests memory to mimic the longest tune. Your scores are saved in a list visible in 
        the Settings section of the game. In the main menu screen there are two buttons: Play and Settings. The 
        settings menu allows the user to adjust game parameters such as tempo, six mode, a mute button, and the ability
        to view scores from previous playthroughs. When you click play with 'six mode' disabled, letters fade
        in and out saying, "Repeat the Sequence" as a sound and accompanying animation highlights one of the four buttons
        for the user to repeat. As the sequence plays, the player can 'interrupt' and begin to copy the sequence
        which cancels the already playing sequence. The same 'interrupt' mechanic occurs if a player copies the wrong tone
        which causes an error tone to play and the random sequence to restart.
